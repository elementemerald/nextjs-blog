Many people have had an experience with Cybersecurity in general, whether it may be visiting a sketchy web page or getting scammed OTP. However, you have to take in mind, **is this too good to be true?** Even a tiny ad could catch you, but we all have adblockers nowadays.

More security and bug squashing has happened throughout the years and more innovation for a better secure web have been coming up. I thought, why not contribute? And I did.

I originally tested a library that allows you to sign your own certificates in C# using the [BouncyCastle C# API](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp). I'm sure there are other libraries for different languages out there, take a look and see what you find. For now, I have expanded on this and made a very "functional" backend that you can use [here](https://github.com/EmeraldSys/emeraldsys-pki-api).]]></content:encoded>
